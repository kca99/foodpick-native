FOODPICK (TENTATIVE NAME)

# Inspiration.

Have indecisive friends? Ever been out hungry but there's just too many options? We have the solution for you! 

# Eliminate your choices.

With Foodpicker (tentatively named), we have created an app with various cuisines that you may enjoy. Just click the ones you have in mind and away you go! The app will automatically pick one and show you the nearest restaurants with that cuisine. Then away you go!

# Features.

- Easy to setup
- Multiplatform for your browser and for your mobile devices
- Easy to use and understand
- Flexible, you don't actually have to eat what we tell you to eat :)

# Installation.

For your browser, you may have to use the old repo for now. The old repository has the same functions, just for our web platform.

For mobile, clone the repo, and use

```shell
npm start 
``` 

Replace npm with yarn if you have it installed. 

Once in, you can scan the QR code given with your phone or enter the URL given in your phone browser (make sure you are on the same network).

The terminal should show other commands should you wish to use a simulator using XCode or Android Studio.
